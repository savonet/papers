\TODO{DB: webradio should be web radio, internet radio or netradio (WP)}
  Generating multimedia streams, such as in a webradio, is a task which is
  complex and difficult to adapt to every users' needs. We introduce a novel
  approach in order to achieve it, based on a dedicated high-level functional
  programming language, called \emph{\liquidsoap{}}, for generating,
  manipulating and broadcasting multimedia streams. Unlike traditional
  approaches, which are based on configuration files or static graphical
  interfaces, it also allows the user to build complex and highly customized
  systems. This language is based on a model for streams and contains operators
  and constructions, which make it adapted to the generation of streams. The
  interpreter of the language also ensures many properties concerning the good
  execution of the stream generation.
  % We describe a model that supports a rich collection of operators (track
  % scheduling, jingle insertion, mix, metadata updates, various transitions), and
  % some aspects of language design that make it adapted to the application
  % domain.
\end{abstract}

The widespread adoption of broadband internet in the last decades has
changed a lot our way of producing and consuming information. Classical
devices from the analog era, such as television or radio broadcasting devices
have been rapidly adapted to the digital world in order to benefit from the new
technologies available. While analog devices were mostly based on hardware
implementations, their digital counterparts often consist in software
implementations,
which potentially offers much more flexibility and modularity in their design.
However, there is still much progress to be done to unleash this
potential in many areas where software implementations remain pretty much as
hard-wired as their digital counterparts.

The design of domain specific languages is a powerful way of addressing
that challenge. It consists in identifying (or designing) relevant
domain-specific abstractions (construct well-behaved objects equipped
with enough operations) and make them available through a programming
language.
The possibility to manipulate rich high-level abstractions
by means of a flexible language
can often release creativity in unexpected ways.
To achieve this, a domain-specific language
should follow three fundamental principles. It should be
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{adapted}: users should be able to perform the required
  tasks in the domain of application of the language;
\item \emph{simple}: users should be able to perform the tasks in a simple way
  (this means that the language should be reasonably concise, but also
   understandable by users who might not be programming language experts);
\item \emph{safe}: the language should perform automatic checks
  to prevent as many errors as possible, using static analysis when
  possible.
\end{enumerate}
Balancing those requirements can be very difficult. This is perhaps
the reason why domain specific languages are not seen more often.
Another reason is that advanced concepts from the theory of
programming language and type systems
are often required to obtain a satisfying design.
% One may, for instance,
% think of Perl, a langage tailored for text processing,
% or PHP, dedicated to dynamic web page creation.

In this paper,
we are specifically interested here in the generation of multimedia streams,
notably containing audio and video.
Our primary targets are netradios, which continuously broadcast
audio streams to listeners over Internet.
At first, generating such a stream might seem to simply consist
in concatenating audio files. In practice, the needs of radio makers
are much higher than this.
For instance, a radio stream will often contain
commercial or informative jingles, which may be scheduled at regular
intervals, sometimes in between songs and sometimes mixed on top of them.
Also, a radio program may be composed of various automatic playlists
depending on the time of the day. Many radios also have live shows,
based on a pre-established schedule or not; a good radio software is also
expected to interrupt a live show when it becomes silent.
Most radios want to control and process the data before broadcasting
it to the public, performing tasks like volume normalization,
compression, etc.
% DB j'ai pas repris le crossfading pcq c bizarre de pas expliquer ce que
%   c'est alors qu'on l'explique dans le corps de l'article,
%   et puis ça commence a faire long
% DB je vire aussi la safety, je pense qu'on a compris qu'il faut qu'il
%   y ait une automatisation...
%   le paragraphe évoquait peut etre le restart, mais c'est anecdotique IMO
% Moreover, the generation of the stream should be rock-solid: most webradios
% are broadcasting automatically 24/7 and don't want to have to manually restart
% the generator if it crashes after a few hours or a few days.
Those examples, among many others, show the need for very flexible and modular
solutions for creating and broadcasting multimedia data. Most of the currently
available tools to broadcast multimedia data over the Internet (such as Darkice,
Ezstream, VideoLAN, Rivendell or SAM Broadcaster) consist of straightforward
adaptation of classical streaming technologies, based on
predefined interfaces, such as a virtual mixing console or static file-based
setups. Those tools perform very well a predefined task, but offer little
flexibility and are hard to adapt to new situations.

In this paper, we present \liquidsoap, a domain-specific language for
multimedia streaming.
%
\liquidsoap\ has established itself as one of
the major tools for audio stream generation.
The language approach has proved successful:
beyond the obvious goal of allowing the flexible combination of
common features, unsuspected possibilities have often been revealed
through clever scripts.
Finally, the modular design of \liquidsoap\ has helped its development and
maintenance, enabling the introduction of several exclusive features
over time.
%
\liquidsoap\ has been developed since 2004
as part of the \savonet\ project~\cite{liquidsoap}.
It is implemented in OCaml,
and we have thus also worked on interfacing many C libraries for OCaml.
The code contains approximatively $20$K lines of OCaml code
and $10$K lines of C code and runs on all major operating systems.
The software along with its documentation is freely
available~\cite{liquidsoap} under an open-source license.
% unique features, flexibility, beyond expectations
% success in bringing academic shit to the crowds
% DB the next paragraph is redundant with section 1, I'll try without
% Interestingly, we have been able to reuse and adapt classical
% techniques and tools for programming languages, which turn out to fit and be
% quite natural in this context: the language \liquidsoap{} is functional (which
% confers a lot of expressiveness to it) and strongly typed (which allows to have
% strong guarantees on the behavior the stream generation).
%

Instead of concentrating on detailing fully the abstractions
manipulated in \liquidsoap\ (streams and sources)
or formally presenting the language and its type system,
this paper provides an overview of the two, focus on some
key aspects of their integration.
% PLAN
We first give a broad
overview of the language and its underlying model in
Section~\ref{sec:liq}.
We then describe two recent extensions of that basic setup.
In Section~\ref{sec:content} we illustrate how various type system
features are combined to control the combination of stream
of various content types.
Section~\ref{sec:clocks} motivates
the interest of having multiple time flows (clocks)
in a streaming system, and presents how this feature is
integrated in \liquidsoap.
After presenting those aspects, we finally compare \liquidsoap\ to
related systems in Section~\ref{sec:related} before concluding
in Section~\ref{sec:conclu}.

A stream can be understood as a timed sequence of data.
In digital signal processing, it will simply be an infinite sequence of 
samples -- floating point values for audio, images for video.
However, multimedia streaming also involves high-level notions.
A \emph{stream}, in \liquidsoap{}, is a succession of \emph{tracks}, annotated
with \textit{metadata}. The tracks can be thought
as individual songs on a musical radio show. 
Metadata are punctual markers storing data, which can occur at any instant in the
stream, and are constituted of a pair of strings consisting of the name of
the metadata and its value. They are used to store various information about the
stream such as copyright information (title or artist of
the current track) or custom information about tracks (for example how loud it
should be played).
Finally, tracks contain data, which consist of float samples 
(for audio data), images (for video data), etc. (see Section~\ref{sec:content}).
%A schematic representation of a stream is given in Figure~\ref{fig:stream}.
\TODO{DB Pour une prochaine version, il y a peut etre une remarque plus
  profonde ici. Les autres outils sont des outil de traitement de flux;
  chez eux une source produit un flux. Chez nous, il y a plus de sources
  que de flux à cause du comportement interactive non trivial.

  Par exemple, la fallibilité. C'est une propriété des sources, invisible
  sur les flux. Si on essaie de réparer ça pour revenir à une vision
  plus fonctionnelle, on met des trous dans la notion de flux. Mais ça ne
  marche toujours pas: la taille du trou dans le flux d'une playlist
  dépend de son contexte (avec quoi elle est mise en fallback).

  Un truc marrant c'est qu'on encapsule ces aspects impératifs dans des
  boites noires, pour n'offrir qu'une vision fonctionnelle à 
  l'utilisateur\ldots}

Streams are generated on the fly interactively by operators which are parametrized by various 
external factors (variables possibly modified by external interfaces and metadata in particular).
In \liquidsoap{}, a stream generator is called a \emph{source}. Some sources
purely produce a stream, getting it from an external device (such as a file, a
sound card or network) or are synthesizing it. Many other sources are actually
operating on other sources in the sense that they produce a stream based on input
streams given by other sources. Abstractly, the program describing the
generation of a stream can thus be represented by a directed acyclic graph,
whose nodes are the sources and whose edges indicate dependencies between
sources (an example is given in Figure~\ref{fig:sharing}).

% Given an acyclic graph describing a stream generator, the roots of the graph are the operator that create 
% the initial streams, called \textit{sources}. Those sources can be created from a single file, a playlist, an HTTP input,
% the sound card, etc. The sources are then modified and composed with each other using 
% \textit{operators} that, for instance, play a source if it is available or a second one otherwise, or modify
% the metadata, mix the audio data of two sources, etc.
% Finally, the leaves of the graph describe the \textit{outputs} of the stream. Those outputs consist, for instance,
%% DB first occurrence of icecast, never introduced
% of playing the stream on the local sound card, saving it to a file or sending it to and Icecast server. 
% For this initial description, we suppose that the graph has only one output.

Some sources have a particular status: not only do they compute a stream like any
other source, but they also perform some observable tasks, typically outputting
their stream somewhere. These are called \emph{active} sources. Stream
generation is performed ``on demand'': active sources actively attempt to
produce their stream, obtaining data from their input sources which in turn
obtain data from their dependent sources, and so on. An important consequence of
this is the fact that \emph{sources do not constantly stream}: if a source would
produce a stream which is not needed by any active source then it is actually
frozen in time.
% DB Technical remark: the source can notice that time still ticks while
%   it is not streaming, but only a few sources use it.
This avoids useless computations, but is also crucial to obtain
the expected expressiveness. For example, a \texttt{rotation} operator will play
alternatively several sources, but should only rotate at the end of tracks, and
its unused sources should not keep streaming, otherwise we might find them in
the middle of a track when we come back to playing them. Likewise, we need to be
able to insert a jingle in between two tracks of a stream, which involves
momentarily stopping it. \emph{Sources are also allowed to fail},
\ie{} refuse to stream at some point in the time at the end of a track (think
for example of a queue of user requests which might often be empty,
or a playlist which takes too long to prepare a file for streaming).

\subsection{A language for building streaming systems}

Based on the streaming model presented above, \liquidsoap{} provides the user
with a convenient high-level language for describing streaming systems.
Although our language borrows from other functional programming languages, it is
has been designed from scratch in order to be able to have a dedicated static
typing discipline together a very user-friendly language. 

One of the main goals which has motivated the design of the \liquidsoap{}
language is that it should be very accessible, even to non-programmers. It
turned out that having a functional programming language is very natural (\cf
Section~\ref{sec:transitions}). The built-in functions of the language often
have a large number of parameters, many of which have reasonable default 
values, and  it would be very cumbersome to have to write them all each time,
in the right order.
In order to address this, we have designed a new extension of
$\lambda$-calculus with labeled arguments and multi-abstractions which makes it
comfortable to use the scripting
API~\cite{baelde-mimram:webradio-lambda}. Having designed our own language also
allowed us to integrate a few domain-specific extensions, to display helpful
error messages and to generate a browsable documentation of the scripting API. In
practice, many of the users of \liquidsoap{} are motivated by creating a radio
and not very familiar with programming, so it can be considered that the design of
the language was a reasonable success from this point of view.

An other motivation was to ensure some safety properties of the stream
generation. A script in \liquidsoap{} describes a system that is intended to run
for months, some parts of whose rarely triggered, and it would be very
disappointing to notice a typo or a basic type error only after a particular
part of the code is used for an important event. In order to ensure essential
safety properties, the language is statically and strongly typed.
We want to put as
much static analysis as possible, as long as it doesn't put the burden on the
user, \ie{} all types should be inferred. As we shall see, \liquidsoap{} also
provides a few useful dynamic analysis.

The current paper can be read without a prior understanding of the language and
its typing system, a detailed presentation can however be found
in~\cite{baelde-mimram:webradio-lambda}. We simply recall that the evaluation of
a \liquidsoap{} script triggers the construction of various sources, built from
various operators built into the language.
\TODO{DB moche, et "built into" c'est pas builtin\ldots préciser}
For example, the following script defines two elementary sources, respectively 
reading from an HTTP stream and a playlist of files, composed in a fallback 
(\ie{} the playlist is used when the HTTP stream is unavailable or
  interrupted), 
and filtered through a volume normalizer.
The resulting stream is sent to an Icecast server which 
broadcasts the stream to listeners,
and saved in a local backup file:
\begin{verbatim}
s = normalize(fallback([input.http("http://other.net/radio"),
                        playlist("listing.txt")])))
output.icecast(%vorbis,mount="myradio",s)
output.file(%vorbis,"backup.mp3",s)
\end{verbatim}
The graph underlying the system resulting from the execution of that script is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sharing}. A few remarks on the syntax: the notation
\hbox{\texttt{[}\ldots\texttt{]}} denotes a list, \texttt{mount}
is a label (the name of an argument of the function \texttt{output.icecast}) and
\texttt{\%vorbis} is an encoding format parameter whose meaning is explained in
Section~\ref{sec:typing-ex}
(recall that Vorbis is a compressed format for audio, similar to MP3).

% \subsection{Fallibility}
% 
% \TODO{DB selon la place, on peut envisager de faire sauter cette section;
%   si on la laisse on peut la merger avec la précédente, en plus compact}
% 
% Finally, the information of whether or not a stream can be assumed to be
% infinite is also carried by the graph. For instance, if a source is created from
% a single file, one can try to decode it before starting streaming. If the file
% can be decoded, and one can assume that the file will not be deleted later, and
% then the source can be considered infallible. Later on, if this source is used,
% for instance in an operator that plays the first available source, then the
% source resulting of this operator is also infallible.  By induction over the
% vertices of the graph, each node can be considered fallible or not. Eventually,
% an infallible output can be considered as describing an infinite stream, while a
% fallible output describes a stream that may not be infinite.

\subsection{Functional transitions}
\label{sec:transitions}

\liquidsoap{} is a \emph{functional} programming language and a particularly
interesting application of this is the case of \textit{transitions}.
Instead of simply sequencing tracks, one may want a smoother transition.
For example, a \emph{crossfade} consists in mixing the end of the old source,
whose volume is faded out, with the
beginning of the new one, whose volume is faded up (see Figure~\ref{fig:cross}).
But there is a wide variety of other possible transitions:
a delay might be added, jingles may be inserted, etc.

\begin{figure}[h]
 \begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=0.8,yscale=0.8]
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,2.5);
\draw (-0.1,2) -- (0.1,2);
\draw (0,2) node[anchor=east]{100};
\draw (0,0) node[anchor=east]{0};
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (7.5,0);
\foreach \x in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} \draw (\x,-0.1) -- (\x,0.1);
\draw (0,2.5) node[anchor=south]{volume (\%)};
\draw (7.5,0) node[anchor=west]{time (sec)};
\draw (0,2) -- (2,2) -- (5,0);
\draw (2,0) -- (4,2) -- (7.5,2);
\draw (1,2) node[anchor=south]{old};
\draw (6,2) node[anchor=south]{new};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
 \fcaption{A crossfade transition between two tracks}
 \label{fig:cross}
 % Stream.png: 500x132 pixel, 91dpi, 14.03x3.70 cm, bb=0 0 398 105
\end{figure}

A solution that is both simple and flexible is to allow the user
to specify a transition as a function that combines two sources
representing the old and new tracks.
%
We illustrate this feature with an example involving transitions
used when switching from one source to another in a \verb.fallback..
% DB fallback has been described already
This is particularly useful when the fallback is track insensitive,
\ie\ performs switching as soon as possible,
  without waiting for the end of a track.
The following code defines a fallback source which performs a crossfade when
switching from one source to another:
\begin{verbatim}
def crossfade(old,new) =
  add([fade.initial(duration=2.,new),fade.final(duration=3.,old)])
end
t = [crossfade,crossfade]
f = fallback(track_sensitive=false,transitions=t,[r,s])
\end{verbatim}

Because any function can be used to define a transition, the possibilities
are numerous. A striking example from the standard library of \liquidsoap{}
scripts is the operator \texttt{smooth\_add}, which takes as
argument a main source (\eg\ musical tracks) and a special interruption
source (\eg\ news items).
When a new interruption is available, \texttt{smooth\_add} gradually
reduces the volume of the main source to put it in the background,
and superposes the interruption. The reverse is performed at the
end of the interruption.
This very appreciated effect is programmed using the same building blocks
as in the previous example.
% \footnote{Unfortunately, the code of this function would not fit in the
%   margin. It is available online at this address: \url{http://bit.ly/aHE0G0}}

\subsection{Efficient implementation}
\TODO{DB Benchmark}

An important aspect of the implementation is efficiency concerning both CPU and
memory usage. The streams manipulated can have high data rates (a typical video
stream needs 30Mo/s) and avoiding multiple copies of the data of the streams is
crucial. This is why we use a reference passing mechanism based on frames. A
\emph{frame} is a buffer of data of fixed duration that represents a portion of
\TODO{DB NON Justement on les crée une seule fois}
the stream. In order to compute a stream, the active sources constantly create
frames and have them filled by passing references to them to their predecessor
sources, which in turn pass the references to their predecessors, and so on.
This passing by reference avoiding copies of data in memory.
% \TODO{DB at this point the reader doesn't see why several frames are needed}
% \TODO{RB I think it is ok now..}

This mechanism is refined in \liquidsoap{} in order to avoid computing twice the
same frame. For instance, one may want to have several outputs of the same
stream, \eg{} one to a server for broadcasting the stream and another one to a
local file for archiving purposes (the circled nodes in
Figure~\ref{fig:sharing}). In this case, the two outputs in the graph are
connected to the same source, and when those outputs transmit their frames to
this source to be filled, the operator should fill them with the same data. In
order to avoid computing the data twice, the first time that the source is asked
to fill a frame, it operates as described before. However, on the second time it
simply fills the frame with the data computed during the first call: computed
frames are \emph{cached} if necessary.
Once all the filling operations have been done, the
sources are informed that the stream has moved on to the next frame and can
forget their cache. The necessity for a source to cache its current frame is
detected when instantiating the stream generator.
% thus copying data in memory only when it is necessary.
\TODO{DB This paragraph doesn't say much; a little more could be said after
  transitions are evoked.}

\section{Heterogeneous stream contents}
\label{sec:content}

\input{hetero.tex}

~

Ideally, we would like to add some more properties to be statically checked by
typing. But it is sometimes difficult to enrich the type system while keeping
a natural syntax and the ability to infer types.
For example,
\liquidsoap{} checks that active sources are \emph{infallible}, \ie{} always
have data available in their input stream, and this check is currently done by a
flow analysis on instantiated sources and not typing.
Another example is clocks which are described next
section.


\section{Clocks}
\label{sec:clocks}
\input{clocks.tex}

\section{Related work} \label{sec:related}

\liquidsoap{} is obviously different from classical tools
such as Ices or Darkice in
that it offers the user the freedom to assemble a stream
for a variety of operators, through a scripting
language rather than traditional configuration files.

\liquidsoap{} has more similarities with multimedia streaming libraries
such as GStreamer~\cite{gstreamer} and digital signal processing (DSP) languages
such as Faust~\cite{faust}.
GStreamer defines a model of stream, and its API
can be used to define streaming systems in various programming
languages (primarily coded in C, but the library has also been
ported to many other languages).
Faust~\cite{faust} provides a high-level functional programming language for
describing stream processing devices,
and compiles this language down to C++, which enables an integration
with various other systems.
It is also worth mentioning Chuck~\cite{chuck}, a DSP programming
language with an emphasis on live coding (dynamic code update).
By provinding a higher-level API, \liquidsoap{} differs
from these tools in the following ways: (1) Its operators are simple and 
hide most of the technicalities. (2) The streams created by
\liquidsoap{} contain additional notions, namely tracks and 
metadata.
\TODO{DB streams or sources}
(3) Streams in \liquidsoap{} are meant for interactive
streaming. In particular, they can be stopped temporarily
or created and destroyed dynamically.
\TODO{DB unlike faust, liquidsoap is interpreted}
It would be very interesting to interface \liquidsoap{} with such tools,
or import some of their techniques.
This could certainly be done with DSP operators, and would allow us to program them efficiently 
from the scripting language rather than in OCaml.
